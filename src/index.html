          The rules are similar to your standard 2D version of snake. The goal
          is to eat as many blocks as possible without hitting the sides of the
          game container or colliding into yourself. Each block that you eat
          increases the size of the snake.
        </p>
        <p class="intro__message__body">
          Navigation is a bit more tricky due to presence of three dimensions.
          You can use the arrow keys or the W, S, A, D keys to direct the snake,
          and can drag the container with your mouse to change your perspective.
          All changes in the snake's direction are relative to its current
          direction.

                The rules are similar to your standard, 2D, version of snake. The goal is to eat as many blocks
                as possible without hitting the sides of the game container, or colliding into yourself. Each
                block that you eat increases the size of the snake.
            </p>
            <p class="intro__message__body">
                Navigation is a bit more tricky due to navigating in three dimensions. You can use the arrow keys
                or the W, S, A, D keys to direct the snake, and can drag the container with your mouse to change
                your perspective. All changes in the snake's direction are relative to its current direction.
